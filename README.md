# Objective:

In order to forecast the content of handwritten photos, we start working on a Handwritten Image Recognition System using machine learning. 
Training a convolutional neural network on a dataset, like MNIST, forms the basis of the system, and it is followed by a smooth user interface integration. 
Users can communicate with the machine learning model through three frameworks: Flask, Streamlit, and Gradio.
